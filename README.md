# NoSQL Sampler

This is experimental code integrating a Node.js Express app with various NoSQL tools, currently built with [redis](http://redis.io/). Not intended as best practices, just experimental.

Tests use Mocha and Chai. Browser modules are built with Browserify. Tasks and watchers are run with Grunt.
